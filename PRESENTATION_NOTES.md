A: User verification system, community ratings, and cultural context in recipe descriptions. Future: expert chef verification badges.

**Q: What makes this different from other recipe apps?**
A: Three key differentiators:
1. Cultural authenticity focus
2. AI-powered personalization
3. Gamification for community contributions

**Q: How would you monetize this?**
A: Freemium model - basic features free, premium features (advanced AI, meal planning, ad-free) paid. Partnership with ingredient delivery services.

**Q: What about users who don't speak Chinese?**
